      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        HRV Focus Monitor is a non-commercial, early-stage research project aimed at predicting cognitive fatigue through biometric signals like heart rate variability (HRV), stress, and sleep data, leveraging the Garmin Health API. The Python-based system is currently tailored to single-user experimentation, optimized for scalability and broader potential usage.

      <h2>Why Garmin?</h2>
      <p>
        Garmin devices provide rich biometric data essential for real-time analysis of stress, recovery, and cognitive performance. HRV and heart-rate insights from Garmin wearables specifically support detailed trend analysis crucial for precise fatigue prediction during cognitively intensive activities.

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Garmin Health API delivers HR, RR intervals, stress, and sleep data in structured JSON format.</li>
        <li><strong>User Input:</strong> Daily subjective ratings on focus, energy, and fatigue complement biometric data.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis and Predictions:</strong> Python models assess correlations to predict cognitive productivity dips proactively.</li>
        <li><strong>Future Goals:</strong> Integration with interactive dashboards and broader user accessibility.</li>
      </ul>
