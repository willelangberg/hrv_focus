# HRV Focus Monitor

**HRV Focus Monitor** is an early-stage research project exploring how heart rate variability (HRV) and behavioral signals can be used to detect cognitive fatigue in real time.

The system is designed to support knowledge workers by predicting drops in mental performance *before they happen*, using biometric signals collected from wearable devices.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- Tracks HRV (e.g. RMSSD) and heart rate from supported wearables
- Combines biometric and self-assessment data (focus, energy, etc.)
- Built in Python for easy customization and analysis
- Intended for personal, non-commercial use during development phase

---

## 📦 Project Status

This is a personal, **non-commercial** research tool currently in early development.  
Only one user (the developer) is involved in testing at this stage.  

> If successful, the system could evolve into a broader fatigue-detection solution for digital professionals and researchers.
